### Entr overview

Today, I would like to introduce you to the project [entr](http://eradman.com/entrproject/).
I discovered this project randomly a while ago, but I had been searching for a tool
like this for a while.

The goal of this tool is to provide a simple command which can launch
a specified command when some files are modified.
Concretely, this tool can be useful if you are searching for an alternative to
livereload, but not related to a specific language and not related to a full
blown [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)

### Example

I often use it to automatically launch tests for [Golang](https://golang.org/) projects I am
developping.

Imagine, I wish to test the following function in the
[`pkg.go`](/post/entr/pkg.go) file:

```golang
// Inc returns the op1 integer incremented by one unit
func Inc(op1 int) int {
	return op1 + 1
}
```

I wish to test it, with this test in [`pkg_test.go`](/post/entr/pkg_test.go):

```golang
func Test_Inc(t *testing.T) {
	actual := Inc(1)
	if actual != 2 {
		t.Errorf("Expecting: <2>, got <%d>", actual)
	}
}
```

I would launch my tests continuously with the following command:
```sh
find *.go | entr -c -s "go test ."
```

Here is a live preview of the result (using asciinema):

{{< asciinema key="entr" rows="31" cols="103" preload="1" >}}

At first, the test is not working, but as soon as the test file is updated, the
test is launched again.
The specificity here, is to use the `-c` flag, in order to clear the screen
before launching the new command.

You can find the full list of options [here](http://eradman.com/entrproject/entr.1.html)

### How does it work ?

In order to avoid [polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science)),
`entr` uses file system events
([kqueue](http://man.openbsd.org/kqueue.2) with BSD,
[inotify](http://man.he.net/?section=all&topic=inotify) with Linux).


### How to get it ?

If you wish to install it, it's really easy, just use your Linux distribution package:

Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, ... :

```
$ apt install entr
```

Centos, ... :

```
$ yum install entr
```

MacOS : 

```
$ brew install entr
```
